# Best Practices
This repository is about software engineering &amp; development best practices.


Before understanding about different best practices it is a must to understand and know 
about some common causes of software development problems.

* End-user needs was not clear or understood inaccurately.
    - Without clear understanding of ultimate goal(End-user requirement) it is not possible to develop software that will satisfy end-users. 
* Inability to deal with **changing requirement**. 
* Modules that don't fit together.
* Software that is hard to **maintain** or **extend**.
* Critical flaws in the project discovered lately.
* Poor software quality
* Unacceptable software performance.
* Team members in each other's way, making it impossible to reconstruct who changed what, when, where, and why?
* An untrustworthy build-and-release process.

There are the projects starts at high speed but can't survive the MVP or passing the MVP project faces difficulties
running smoothly, and lot of projects fail. Although different projects fail for different reasons, it appears that
most of them fail because of causes mentioned below:

* Ad hoc requirements management.
* Ambiguous and imprecise communication. 
* Weakly designed architectures with critical flaws. 
* Unnecessarily made it complex or Overwhelming complexity
* Ambiguous requirements which leads to inconsistencies designs,
  and implementations.
* Insufficient/Poor testing.
* Subjective project status assessment.
* Failure to attack risk.
* Uncontrolled change propagation.
* Insufficient automation.
